# Adventures with augmentation
Adventures with data augmentation techniques on microscope image

## What's under way
1. Training a CNN on the original and the augmented dataset and comparing test set accuracies
2. Trying to find out which augmentation technique works best for the cell images 
3. Experiment with the augmentation techniques and reach a high accuracy on the test set
