# Blood-cells-dataset
Adventures with data augmentation techniques on microscope images. Then training a CNN upon the data generated.

## Whats under way
1. Training a CNN on the original and the augmented dataset and comparing test set accuracies
2. Trying to find out which augmentation technique works best for the cell images
